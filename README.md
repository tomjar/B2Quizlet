# B2Quizlet
heavily modifed updated version of a tutorial by Michael Fudge which is located http://projects.oscelot.org/gf/project/b2sk/

This JAVA "building block" is intended for use in Blackboard web application. This is simply a example/tutorial that I attempted to 
complete in order to learn about Blackboard and the use of Building Blocks, pray you never get hired to develop Building Blocks 
for use in Blackboard. It can be quite a pain.
